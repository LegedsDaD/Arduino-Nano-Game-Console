Based on the code you provided (sketch_nov20a.ino), here is a comprehensive README.md file tailored for your GitHub repository. It includes the features, hardware requirements, wiring instructions based on your pin definitions, and instructions on how to play.You can copy and paste the following markdown directly into your repository's README file.Arduino Nano Multi-Game Console 🎮A compact, retro-style handheld game console powered by an Arduino Nano and an SSD1306 OLED display. This project features three classic games, a menu system, and supports both single-player and two-player modes.🕹️ Features3 Classic Games:Pong: Play against a jitter-free AI or a second player (local multiplayer).Snake: The classic arcade game with smooth 4-way movement.Space Dodge: An endless runner style game where you dodge falling stars.Menu System: Easily switch between games with a scrollable menu.System Features:Long-press (1 second) on any button to return to the main menu.Debounced button inputs.Optimized ball physics and speed scaling in Pong.High score tracking (current session).🛠️ Hardware RequiredMicrocontroller: Arduino Nano (or compatible)Display: 0.96" I2C OLED Display (SSD1306 Driver, 128x64 resolution)Controls: 2x Analog Joystick ModulesConnection: Breadboard and jumper wires (or a custom PCB)🔌 Wiring / PinoutConnect the components according to the definitions in the code:I2C OLED DisplayOLED PinArduino PinNoteVCC5VGNDGNDSCLA5Standard I2C ClockSDAA4Standard I2C DataPlayer 1 Joystick (Left)Joystick PinArduino PinDescriptionVRXA0X-AxisVRYA1Y-Axis (Used for Menus/Pong)SWD2Button (Digital Input)VCC5VGNDGNDPlayer 2 Joystick (Right)Joystick PinArduino PinDescriptionVRXA2X-AxisVRYA3Y-AxisSWD3Button (Digital Input)VCC5VGNDGND> Note: The joystick buttons use INPUT_PULLUP, so they trigger when connected to Ground (LOW).💻 Software & LibrariesTo compile this project, you need the Arduino IDE and the following libraries installed via the Library Manager:Adafruit GFX LibraryAdafruit SSD1306Installation StepsClone or download this repository.Open sketch_nov20a.ino (or rename it to GameConsole.ino) in the Arduino IDE.Connect your Arduino Nano.Select the correct board (Arduino Nano) and COM port.Click Upload.🎮 How to PlayNavigationScroll Menu: Use Player 1 Joystick Up/Down.Select Game: Press Player 1 Stick Button.Exit to Menu: Hold Any Button for 1 second during gameplay, then release when prompted.The Games1. Pong (1P vs AI / 2P Versus)Goal: Deflect the ball past your opponent. First to 5 points wins.Controls: Move joystick Up/Down to control the paddle.1P Mode: You play on the left; the AI plays on the right.2P Mode: Player 1 on the left, Player 2 on the right.2. SnakeGoal: Eat the food dots to grow. Avoid hitting walls or your own tail.Controls: Use Player 1 Joystick (Up, Down, Left, Right) to steer.3. Space DodgeGoal: Dodge the falling stars for as long as possible. Score increases over time.Controls: Use Player 1 Joystick Left/Right to move the spaceship.⚙️ ConfigurationIf your screen remains black, check the I2C address in the code:C++#define SCREEN_ADDRESS 0x3C // Try 0x3D if 0x3C doesn't work
